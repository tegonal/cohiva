## Your First Code Contribution
Fantastic, thanks for your effort! 
 
The following are a few guidelines on how we suggest you start.
 
1. Fork the repository to your repositories (see [Fork a repo](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) for help). 
2. Read up the [Pull Request Checklist](#pull-request-checklist)

Perfect, you are setup and ready to go. 
Have a look at [help wanted issues](https://github.com/ORG_NAME_GITHUB/PROJECT_NAME_GITHUB/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
where [good first issues](https://github.com/ORG_NAME_GITHUB/PROJECT_NAME_GITHUB/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
are easier to start with.
Please write a comment such as `I'll work on this` in the issue,
this way we can assign the task to you (so that others know there is already someone working on the issue)
and it gives us the chance to have a look at the description again and revise if necessary.

<a name="git"></a>
*Git*  

Dealing with Git for the first time? Here are some recommendations for how to set up Git when working on an issue: 
- create a new branch for the issue using `git checkout -b <branch-name>` (preferably, the branch name
  should be descriptive of the issue or the change being made, e.g `#108-path-exists`.) Working
  on a new branch makes it easier to make more than one pull request.
- add this repository as a remote repository using
 `git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORG_NAME_GITHUB/PROJECT_NAME_GITHUB.git`. You will use this to
  fetch changes made in this repository.
- to ensure your branch is up-to-date, rebase your work on
  upstream/main using `git rebase upstream/main` or `git pull -r upstream main`.
  This will add all new changes in this repository into your branch and place your
  local unpushed changes at the top of the branch.

You can read more on Git [here](https://git-scm.com/book/).  
Contact us via a [new discussion](https://github.com/ORG_NAME_GITHUB/PROJECT_NAME_GITHUB/discussions/new?category=contributor-q-a)
whenever you need help to get up and running or have questions.

*Create a Draft*

We recommend you create a pull request (see [About pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) for help)
in case you are not sure how you should do something. 
This way we can give you fast feedback regarding multiple things (style, does it go in the right direction etc.) before you spend time for nothing.
Prepend the title with `[WIP]` (work in progress) or mark it as draft and leave a comment with your questions.

*Push your changes and create a PR*

Finally, when you think your PR (short for pull request) is ready, then please:

1. read the [Pull Request Checklist](#pull-request-checklist) 
2. Create your first pull-request
3. 👏👏👏 you have submitted your first code contribution to ORG_NAME_GITHUB/PROJECT_NAME_GITHUB 😊
