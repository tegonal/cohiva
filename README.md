# Cohiva

Cohiva is an open-source tool that facilitates administration and community-building in housing projects. It is mainly targeted at housing cooperatives, but it is suited for any housing management organization with a community related focus.

The core of Cohiva is built on the Python web framework <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>. The progressive web app component uses the <a href="https://quasar.dev/">Quasar</a> VueJs framework.

<b>Status:</b> Cohiva is derived from a codebase that was originally developed specifically for <a href="https://www.warmbaechli.ch">Wohnbaugenossenschaft Warmbächli</a> in Switzerland. The codebase is currently being transformed into a more generic form and will be made available here for further development. For now, the user interface is only available in German.

For more information see https://www.cohiva.ch (in German).
